# ❤️ Valentine’s Day Animated Intro (SwiftUI)

An advanced SwiftUI animation project demonstrating custom rendering, particle systems, animation orchestration, and performance optimization in a production-ready architecture.

Built entirely with **native SwiftUI** — no third-party libraries.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To showcase advanced SwiftUI animation capabilities, state-driven rendering, and GPU-optimized compositing while maintaining smooth 60fps performance.

This project highlights clean architecture, modular components, and animation precision.

---

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

### 💓 Custom Animatable Shape
- Built a dynamic `HeartShape` using `Shape`
- Leveraged `animatableData` for smooth morph transitions
- Implemented organic breathing/pulse timing

### 💥 Interactive Particle Explosion System
- Randomized vector-based motion (angle + velocity)
- Automatic lifecycle cleanup
- Performance-safe state management

### 💕 Floating Background Particle Layer
- Lightweight reusable particle component
- Continuous animation using implicit animation loops
- No timers, no frame drops

### 🌅 Advanced Compositing & Visual Effects
- Layered `RadialGradient`
- `.blendMode(.screen)` for glow realism
- `.compositingGroup()` + `.drawingGroup()` for GPU acceleration

### 🎬 Animation Orchestration
- Coordinated implicit & explicit animations
- Carefully tuned easing curves
- Staggered entrance sequencing
